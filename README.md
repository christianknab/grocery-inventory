# Project idea

Creating a solution to manage at home food inventory to reduce time it takes to create grocery lists.

# Why?

I have a very niche problem that I would like to solve in my home: grocery inventory.

My family tries to be very conscious about what groceries we buy â€“ try not to buy food we already have. I set us up to use AnyList which contains a current inventory of each item with a recent updated date. However, the process to update this is tedious and manual and tends to get skipped, which almost makes this system useless because the inventory is innacurate.

I like when systems work seamlessly, so I have been thinking about how I will solve this problem.

# Plan

The project needs to be broken down into multiple parts:

### Barcode scanning

Currently, I am thinking of buying a barcode scanner to scan the item (so no phone needs to be taken out of pocket), identify the product name with a **barcode database** (https://www.barcodelookup.com/api ??), then... ->

### Anylist app integration

... identify the item in our AnyList shopping list, update the quantity there.
