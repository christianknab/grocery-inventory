Each ingredient is carefully sourced and selected‚ providing nutrient density‚ optimized absorption‚ and utilization of key nutrients.*All of their multivitamins contain: • chelated and fermented minerals (fermented with Saccharomyces cerevisiae‚ whole foods‚ and probiotics) • coenzyme B Vitamins (B Vitamins in their most active form) • a bone- and cardio- supportive form of Vitamin K2 from MenaQ7®† True Transparency You’ve probably seen plenty of multivitamins out there. They all contain a range of minerals and vitamins. What they don’t offer is transparency about whether those ingredients are present at levels that will make a difference to your health.*\"But we do.\"††True Grace selects ingredients that play a concrete role in true health‚ and they include them at effective doses—never just a sprinkle or a dash.* There’s no room for fillers or a “kitchen sink” approach that just tosses a bit of everything in. When they add ingredients you wouldn’t expect to see in a multivitamin‚ like adaptogens and medicinal mushrooms.True Grace sources the highest-quality vitamins from wholesome sources‚ and they use fermented and chelated minerals because they’re more bioavailable—aka readily absorbed and easily digested.*Wherever possible‚ True Grace uses ingredients that are Non-GMO‚ Organic‚ and Regeneratively Grown With True Grace‚ you can be confident in the product you’re taking. This is true transparency.Key IngredientsOrganic Mushroom Blend (Fruiting Body Extracts)At True Grace‚ they use certified organic mushrooms that are grown on a farm‚ where they’re nurtured by natural light and fresh air. Many other supplements on the market use mushrooms grown in a lab on a base of grains. These mushrooms are also cultivated on materials that are native to each mushroom‚ including sawdust‚ logs‚ and trees. This mirrors how mushrooms grow in nature: on surfaces that range from decaying wood to living trees.The various types of wood they use are “food” for the mushrooms. Wood provides raw ingredients that the mushrooms transform into compounds that support your health.* Without this natural base‚ the mushrooms couldn’t produce these components in meaningful amounts.True Grace takes these organic mushrooms and use a multi-step hot water extraction method to create potent extracts that are full of beta glucans and other healthful compounds‚* with no grain fillers. The extracts are easy for your body to absorb and use. They also come exclusively from the fruiting body: the stem‚ gills‚ and cap of each mushroom‚ which are more abundant in key active compounds than the mushrooms’ mycelium (root-like strands).They use mushrooms with a long history of traditional use and a more recent history of scientific backing:• Reishi supports healthy aging*• Maitake supports immunity*• Chaga supports healthy digestion*• Shiitake supports heart health*• Lion’s Mane supports brain health* Regenerative and Organic Adaptogen BlendHoly Basil and Ashwagandha are Ayurvedic herbs known as “adaptogens.” They both help the body adapt to stress and support overall health and well-being.*True Grace sources certified organic and regenerative adaptogenic herbs from one of the most experienced and diversified herb farms in North America. Why? Regenerative farming methods increase the biodiversity and health of the soil. Healthy soil produces high-quality herbs. Heart Support BlendB Vitamins and Vitamin K2 support heart health. B vitamins are important for the formation of red bloods cells‚ and Vitamin K2 is shown to improve arterial flexibility and prevent calcium deposits in arteries and blood vessels.*†† Disclaimer made by manufacturer.† MenaQ7® is a registered trademark of NattoPharma‚ Norway.
